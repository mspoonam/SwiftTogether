/**
 Comparing Structures and Classes
 */

/**
 Structures and classes in Swift have many things in common. Both can:

 Define properties to store values

 Define methods to provide functionality

 Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax

 Define initializers to set up their initial state

 Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation

 Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind
 */

/**
 Classes have additional capabilities that structures donâ€™t have:

 Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.

 Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.

 Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.

 Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.
